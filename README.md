# Cab_Booking_Application
# Online Cab Booking Spring Boot Application

The approach in which riders and drivers are available on a single platform is known as online cab booking. Riders can hire a vehicle in a single click to travel to any place by selecting their preferred vehicle type. The nearest driver will accept the booking. The customer is then picked up and dropped off at their location by the driver.

The goal of an online cab booking system is to bring riders and drivers together on one platform. The online cab booking system makes traveling easier in this digital age by allowing you to move from one location to another with a single tap.
